A tile-based farming simulator developed using **Python and Pygame** for my A Level Computer Science NEA project.

## Gameplay Overview

Plant crops, earn money, and manage your rent before the timer runs out! Each crop grows over time and can be sold for profit. A recurring **rent timer** forces you to balance growth and income strategically.

## Rent System
- Initial rent: £100
- Every rental cycle increases rent by £100
- If you can't pay, the game ends
- You can **disable rent** in the Options menu

- **Tile Position** – Coordinates of the selected tile (e.g., (1, 3))
- **Crop** – Type of crop planted
- **Progress** – Growth percentage (0%–100%)
- **Value** – Sell value of the crop
- **Rent Timer** – Time remaining before rent is due
